# Face_mask_detection
This project aims to develop a robust and efficient face mask detection system using computer vision techniques and deep learning models. The system can automatically detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in real-time or on images/videos.
# Features
Real-time face mask detection using webcam or video feed
Batch processing for image datasets
High accuracy and reliability
Easy-to-use API for integration into other applications
Key Components
# Face Detection: The system uses state-of-the-art face detection algorithms to locate faces in images or video frames.

# Mask Classification: A deep learning model is employed to classify faces into two categories: "with mask" and "without mask."

# Alert Mechanism: Whenever the system detects someone without a face mask in a controlled environment (e.g., retail store, office), it can trigger an alert to notify relevant personnel.
